# Digital-Alarm-Clock
I have designed digital alarm clock in semester 4 as individual project. In this design main purpose was designing a consumable and marketable product. Controller PCB, enclosure design, documentation have been done my self. When it comes to alarm clock features you are given are below:

- Show real time clock
- Set alarm, stopwatch, timer
- Working with recharble battery power 
- Can be used as power bank

## Conceptual Circuit Diagram
This is the first thing I have done in this project. I drew what are the things going to be used and how they are conneted each other as block on a paper. Modules are 3 cell Li-iron battery pack, Li-iron battery charging module, power adpeter(12v), buck convertor, microcontroller, real time clock module, speaker, display, power bank module and buttons which are drawn in conceptual designing step.

## Conceptual Enclosure Design
These are first hand drawn sketches before designing real enclosure.

## Schematic Diagrams
I had to design pcb for controllering the all modules. ATmega328 microcontroller is used which controls changing time and date, alarm/stopwatch/timer/ , power bank , display/speaker setting and input buttons. Shcematic Diagram was drawn using Altium Designer.

## PCB Designs
When we design a consumable product we always have to care about size of that because customers may think portability like alarm clocks. Therefore I designed a PCB for controllering dimensions as 8cm*8cm. PCB also was drawn using Altium Designer. PCB was imported from jlcpcb(company). This is a two layer pcb.

## Enclosure Designs
3D model for enclosure was drawn using Solidworks. There are two parts in the clock. One part is body where all the pcb, baterries, modules are placed. Another part is used as lid which is attached using screws. for the prototype enclosure ws 3D printed. But for large production, plastic injection molding have be done.

## Testing and Assembling
This most exciting step. All the things going to be tested in here. Fisrt I separately tested all the modules and then assemble them and check.When there are problems I had to troubleshoot each of those. For programming atmega328 arduino IDE was used. Photographs during assembling and testing are below.
